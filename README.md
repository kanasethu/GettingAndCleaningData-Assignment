## Data Set Informatiom
The original experiment was carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity was captured at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments were video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset was been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

This analysis:
- merges the training and test data
  - read `X_train.txt`, `y_train.txt` and `subject_train.txt` from the "./train" folder
  - read `X_test.txt`, `y_test.txt` and `subject_test.txt` from the "./test" folder
  - `join` the six data sets into three: `joinData`, `joinLabel` and `joinSubject`
- `joinData` has 561 columns corresponding to 561 variables and 10299 rows/observations.  Pare this down to the 66 variables which store information on Means and StandardDeviation (`features.txt` was consulted for variable names).
- columns of joinData was named using data from `features.txt`.  column names were cleaned to remove "_" and "()"
- read `activity_labels.txt` and change joinLabel to store descriptive activity names intsead of numbers.
- combine `joinSubject`, `joinLabel` and `joinData` into one single data frame called `tidyData`.  `tidyData` is a data Frame of dimension `10299x68`.  The first columns stores subject data, the second indicates the activity name and the remaining 66 columns store the following Means and StandardDeviation informatiion.

- `tidyData` is written into a file `tidyData.txt` and can be read using the command `read.table("tidyData.txt")`
- finally, the `dplyr` package is used to calculate means of each column by subject and activity and store this in a dplyr table `data_means`.
- `data_means` is written into a file `tidyDataMeans.txt` and can be read using the command `read.table("tidyDataMeans.txt")`
